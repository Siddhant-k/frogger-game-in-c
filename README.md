# Frogger Game in C

This repository contians all the code I used to implmenet the classic arcade game: Frogger. Last tested on a LandTiger LPC1768 board but you can try it on just about board!

There is control via the joystick, or a UART setup through the computer keyboard. Remember to set PuTTy (or any other serial interface applicationthat you use) to the correct settings for your board.

Enjoy!
